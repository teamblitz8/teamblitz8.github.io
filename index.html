                <h1>Who are we?</h1>
                <p class="para">We are Team Blitz of Saint Olave's Grammar School, a group of 4 dedicated team members with a burning passion of STEM and DT. We all came together over the months, collaborating with each other with our own various different skillsets and thinking. We thoroughly enjoy the hands-on experience the F1 in Schools club provides us and the teamwork & collaboration skills we have developed on our journey, helping us get to where we are with our car, portfolio and brand today!</p>
                <br>
                <h1>What is F1 in Schools?</h1>
                <p class="para">F1 in Schools is a STEM-based fun activity with the goal of introducing students to STEM subjects in an engaging way, using the theme of F1 to encourage students to compete. Students create a miniature F1 car with F1-style features to maximise aerodynamics, thinking through aesthetics, manufacturing, sketches and designing on CAD, designing a portfolio to document their journey and even developing a brand to display at the competition and raise funds for getting the best resources possible!</p>

                        <p>As well as designing our logo and leading the team, Yash has dedicated himself to learning many skills to aid each one of us in our roles, including himself - being the first to start learning CAD (Fusion 360) and organising & delegating tasks. He has also played a massive role in manufacturing: priming, painting, assembling, attaching vinyls and so much more, dedicating hours to the car.</p>

He also has a strong passion for Art which allowed him to draw detailed 3D designs on paper with his incredible art skills, enabling us to start CAD work rapidly.</p>

                    <h2>Dash v2</h2>
                    <h3>Drag - 0.24974529N</h3>
                    <p>Dash v2 is our first car we have created and competed with, going through many stages to reach where it has got to. It has performed the best in CFD testing between our other prototypes, and has a balanced amount of airflow around the car. It has minor changes from the Dash v1 and a new rear wing following advice from experienced teams in our school: A longer tear drop shape rather than an oval. This new rear wing introduced in the last few months of the design-test cycle after other DEV and PRO F1 in Schools teams recommended us to try a longer rear wing. Promising CFD results led us to produce this final car to be manufactured for the competition day. It is made up of 3 parts: Pierce for the front wing, Flat for the side pod, and elipse for the rear wing. These parts were chosen because they performed the best in initial rounds of testing and its chemistry between one another was also great, according to the CFD results. Not only that, the minor adjustments we made to the connection between side and rear pod for example also proved useful in our CFD results. We hope that Dash v2 will lead us to success on competition day, as we have worked incredibly hard (and smart) to achieve this car. Not only that, it took around 2 weeks to go from concept to finished product, after many coats of paint, primer and vinyl stickers.</p>
